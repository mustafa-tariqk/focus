# focus

How to use: 
Put these links in as custom filters in your ad blocker:
* [Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mustafa-tariqk/focus/main/twitter.txt)
* [YouTube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mustafa-tariqk/focus/main/youtube.txt)
* [Instagram]() (not available yet)
* [Reddit]() (not available yet)

I was inspired by https://github.com/hadig/Focus-for-Youtube and wanted to do something similar but for more applications.
