# focus

The internet and social media are awesome. They allow us to be connected to people we care about.
However, all of these companies rely on our constant consumption of media to make money.

There will never be a company for a simple social media app just to catch up with friends, because
they'll never make enough money off of us compared to the traditional route. 

We have to take things into our own hands. These filters rip all algorithmic feeds and distractions
from online platforms. Allowing them to be tools instead of distractions.

How to use: 
Put these links in as custom filters in your ad blocker:
* [Twitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mustafa-tariqk/focus/main/twitter.txt)
* [YouTube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mustafa-tariqk/focus/main/youtube.txt)
* [Instagram]() (not available yet)
* [Reddit]() (not available yet)

### Special thanks
I was inspired by https://github.com/hadig/Focus-for-Youtube and wanted to do something similar but for more applications.
